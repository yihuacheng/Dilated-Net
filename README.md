# Dilated-Net
The Pytorch Implementation of "Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation Using Dilated-Convolutions". (updated in 2021/04/28)


We build benchmarks for gaze estimation in our survey [**"Appearance-based Gaze Estimation With Deep Learning: A Review and Benchmark"**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12668).
This is the implemented code of the "Dilated-Net" method in our benchmark. Please refer our survey for more details.

We recommend you to use **data processing codes** provided in <a href="http://phi-ai.org/GazeHub/" target="_blank">*GazeHub*</a>.
You can direct run the method' code using the processed dataset.

## Introduction
We provide two similar projects for leave-one-person-out evaluation and evaluation of common training-test split.
They have the same architecture but different started modes.

Each project contains following files/folders.
- `model.py`, the model code.
- `train.py`, the entry for training.
- `test.py`, the entry for testing.
- `config/`, this folder contains the config of the experiment in each dataset. To run our code, **you should write your own** `config.yaml`. 
- `reader/`, the data loader code. You can use the provided reader or write your own reader.

## Getting Started
### Writing your own *config.yaml*

Normally, for training, you should change 
1. `train.save.save_path`, The model is saved in the `$save_path$/checkpoint/`.
2. `train.data.image`, This is the path of image, please use the provided data processing code in <a href="http://phi-ai.org/GazeHub/" target="_blank">*GazeHub*</a>
3. `train.data.label`, This is the path of label.
4. `reader`, This indicates the used reader. It is the filename in `reader` folder, e.g., *reader/reader_mpii.py* ==> `reader: reader_mpii`.

For test, you should change 
1. `test.load.load_path`, it is usually the same as `train.save.save_path`. The test result is saved in `$load_path$/evaluation/`.
2. `test.data.image`, it is usually the same as `train.data.image`.
3. `test.data.label`, it is usually the same as `train.data.label`.
 
### Training

In the leaveout folder, you can run
```
python train.py config/config_mpii.yaml 0
```
This means the code will run with `config_mpii.yaml` and use the `0th` person as the test set.

You also can run
```
bash run.sh train.py config/config_mpii.yaml
```
This means the code will perform leave-one-person-out training automatically.   
`run.sh` performs iteration, you can change the iteration times in `run.sh` for different datasets, e.g., set the iteration times as `4` for four-fold validation.

In the traintest folder, you can run
```
python train.py config/config_mpii.yaml
```

### Test
In the leaveout folder, you can run
```
python test.py config/config_mpii.yaml 0
```
or
```
bash run.sh test.py config/config_mpii.yaml
```

In the traintest folder, you can run
```
python test.py config/config_mpii.yaml
```

### Result
After training or test, you can find the result from the `save_path` in `config_mpii.yaml`.
